## Welcome to 7th episode of my series **Code for Security**.  

<div align="center"> <img src="cover.png"/> </div>  
  
When 7th episode shows up, the Legendary man, Hyde4thHeaven is also known as "the Man with Seven Episodes", due to the seven episode engraved on his wall patterned after the shape of the Big Dipper. Hyde4thHeaven's famous catchphrase just prior to an vulnerability's death is "You are already dead!" (お前はもう死んでいる, Omae wa mō shindeiru).
  
    
## Solution
  
   
**Another secure function is done!** Secured coding is just a flipped hand when you know the hint!

Let's hunt more vulnerable code to make **Code for Security** next episode. Stay tuned!  
  
**#generate_private_key() #Code4Sec**
